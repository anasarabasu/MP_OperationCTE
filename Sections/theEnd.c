    Perfect Ending: Anya succeeds in submitting her project and ends up with near-top ranks in the exams. As a result, she is awarded the Stella Star, with Mr. Henderson praising her for her performance being “Very Elegant”. This ending is achievable by obtaining a PERFECT rating in ALL memorable photos for ALL venues. 

    Neutral Ending: Anya submits her project, but there are better projects that have been submitted. However, she passes her exams, but does not earn the Stella Star. This ending is achieved by obtaining a PERFECT memorable photo rating in at least 3 venues and maxing out her Math and PE levels 

    Bad Ending: Anya submits her project, but it is incomplete. Likewise, she does not pass her exams and, to Loid’s dismay, Anya gets a Tonitrus bolt for her performance. This ending is obtained if less than 3 PERFECT memorable photo ratings are obtained or her PE and MATH levels are not maxed out Page
